                        <p>This application is still in a very alpha-stage, so expect your browser to explode, your mouse to run away, and
                            your madness level to raise to unexpected heights. No, seriously, it will brake, but... </p>
                        <p>Think of it as a proposal, a suggestion of how we could hand our clients a way to explore our data
                            in an exciting way.</p>
                        <p>So what does this marvelous machine do?</p>
                        <p>It is a machine to transform our data  - which is secretly hiding in countless tables and rows - to a graphical <marked>network</marked> which invites to browse and explore.
                            So when judging this machine, think of all the nice usecases for which this way of graphical presentation could be just what
                            you always missed while looking at our data.</p>
                        <p>So think:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Risk and Compliance: wouldn't it be nice to be able to see the complicated structure of sub-subsidiaries rather than read it
                            in some hidden field?</li>
                            <li>VentureSource: browse from company to company and find connections you didn't expect nor see before</li>
                            <li>PEP: discover the network connecting all the relevant entities and key players</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Up to this point, with DJ Nodes you can only take a stroll through the data from VentureSource.</p>
                        <p>So search for the newest fancy startup and look how it is connected to everything else.</p>
                        <p>Enjoy and hopefully have fun!</p>
